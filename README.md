Kandi is a social platform that eases users into the festival community by rewarding attendees for capturing festive memories, making new connections, and completing a series of tasks involving festival traditions. We drew inspiration from the festival tradition of making and exchanging "kandi" bracelets that traditionally signify a memorable music festival experience (fun fact: they're similar to the bracelets that Swifties trade at Eras concerts!)


When opening Kandi for the first time, users are prompted to login or create a new account. Users can explore features such as viewing and completing tasks in their task list, searching for and adding friends, and viewing friends’ planned events in their communities tab. 

Users can complete tasks—which are classified into individual and group tasks—to earn beads that are then added to their personal string. Users can also easily search up friends that they want to add and view the profile of. Once a user has added at least one friend, the community page updates to include events that the user’s friends are going to, and they are able to create a group to complete a group task. All user data is saved to a database hosted on Supabase.
